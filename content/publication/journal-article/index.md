abstract: Monitoring progress on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is important for both academic and non-academic organizations. Existing approaches to monitoring SDGs have focused on specific data types, namely, publications listed in proprietary research databases. We present the text2sdg R package, a user-friendly, open-source package that detects SDGs in any kind of text data using several different query systems from any text source. The text2sdg package thereby facilitates the monitoring of SDGs for a wide array of text sources and provides a much-needed basis for validating and improving extant methods to detect SDGs from text.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: The text2sdg R package implements several methods, including a state-of-the-art ensemble model, to identify SDGs from text.
